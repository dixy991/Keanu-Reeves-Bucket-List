                After successfully finishing both kindergarten and elementary school, I decided to continue my education at the Philological High School because I really liked learning about languages. I was so good that I managed to master six of them ( English, French, Latin, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin), but I realized I needed a new challenge...I always wanted to talk to the machines and the best way to do that is by learning computer languages. I will be able to speak to my laptop, right?
